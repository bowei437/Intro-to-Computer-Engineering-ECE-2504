// ECE 2504 Spring 2015  Design project 2
// 
// This text file contains the memory contents of the ROM
// in hex.   The ROM is 20 bits wide, which is 5 hex digits per address.
// 
//  opcode is bits 19:16, operandA is bits 15:8, and operandB is bits 7:0.
//  For example, the first entry is 4AA11, so the opcode is 4, operandA is AA,
//  and operandB is 11 (all values in hex).
//  
//  The ROM has 16 addresses.  
//  
//  You should modify the contents of this file to use your opcodes for 
//  the ALU operations, and operands for testing your ALU.  Do not list
//  more than 16 values in this file.
// 
//  "@<number>" specifies the memory location of the next line of data 
//  and then the next lines are in consecutive locations.
