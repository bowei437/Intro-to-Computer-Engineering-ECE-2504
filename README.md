# Introduction to Computer Engineering : ECE 2504
This is the repository for my class at Virginia Tech on Introduction to Computer Engineering. It was the most important class I took while in College and provided me the fundamentals to comptuer engineering

In this class, we learned the following things:
* Fundamentals of modern computing
* Coding in C and Verilog HDL
* Introductory aspects of Finite State Machines
* Writing Verilog code on a Altera DE1 SoC FPGA
* Combinational Logic and base binary arithmetic
* 2s complement, signed magnitude, 1s complement
* Karnaugh Maps and Truth Table
* Electrical Gate Level design for transistors
* Assembly Programming (Jump, LD, ADD, OR etc)
